## Punk Beers 

This web application allows you to explore the Brewdog's beer catalogue using the [Punk API](https://punkapi.com/).

You can search beers by name, alcohol average, or IBU value. You can also go through the results and open detail information of each beer.

This Project uses [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) library to render UI components and the [Semantic UI Css](https://semantic-ui.com) to give the page a general style.

You can see a demo in the following GitHub page: [PunkBeers](https://nicoburghi.github.io/react-assignment/)

# React assignment

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and ejected to have full control over its configuration.

To complete the assignment, fork this repo and send us a PR. To help us assess the assignment, please commit often and use clear and concise commit messages.

## The assignment

Create an application that:

- retrieves data from an API (refer to https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis/ for public APIs)
- shows a grid of items (thumbnails, cards, etc.)
- has a form that allows filtering the data set
- shows item details (large image or other information available from the API's response) in a modal when an item is clicked

## Requirements

- Test coverage is sufficient
- Linter and tests pass
- Works in IE11 and up
- Eslint rules extend [eslint-config-endouble](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@endouble.com/eslint-config-endouble)
- Uses web fonts (eg. Google Fonts)
- Runs on HTTPS
- Third-party package usage kept to a minimum
- No state managers (MobX, Redux, ...)
- UI is accessible by keyboard
- Code is documented
- Items in the grid show up to four items per row and gracefully degrade to a vertical list on narrow screens
